You are travelling peacefully back from adventures, contemplating on train heading to Eden, your home town.
But beware, as the train is attacked by roaming hordes of monsters. Even more unfortunately, main engine was damaged, and you are losing power.
Keep the engine running with burning inventory on train, and even monsters (if you manage to knock them out). Cheers, sir!
